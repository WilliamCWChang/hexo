Selena Gomez, Marshmello - Wolves (Visualizer)

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
你的眼底，盡是抑鬱的藍
One to love, and one to lose
渴望著愛，又同時嚮往離散
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
現實裡的鴻溝，甜蜜卻沉重
Water or wine, don't make me choose
別逼我選擇，要風華絕代還是平凡

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
我還想重溫 那年盛夏的纏綿夜晚
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
在悸動裡微醺著，獨自一人望著漫天星海

I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves
我曾翻越窮山惡水，與狼群馳騁在荒野間
To get to you, to get to you
只為了靠近你，更靠近你一些
I've been down the darkest alleys. Saw the dark side of the moon
我曾在陰暗的巷弄裡徘徊，目睹邪惡的念頭蠢蠢欲動
To get to you, to get to you
只為更了解你，更貼近你一些
I've looked for love in every stranger. Took too much to ease the anger
我曾周旋在陌生人間尋找歸所，真心卻換來惱火
All for you, yeah, all for you
踏遍人生，只為了遇見你

I've been running through the jungle. I've been crying with the wolves
我曾穿梭過陰鬱叢林，與狼群在月夜下長嚎
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
只為在蒼茫人海間，與你碰頭

To get to you
To get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
你的指尖 滑過肌膚
To places I have never been
領著我到達 前所未有的境界
Blindly, I am following
盲目地 任由你牽引
Break down these walls and come on in
心牆在一念間崩塌，請你進駐吧

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
我還想重溫 那年盛夏的纏綿夜晚
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
醉倒在洶湧情感，任由群星將我覆蓋

I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves
我曾翻越窮山惡水，與狼群馳騁在荒野間
To get to you, to get to you
只為了靠近你，更靠近你一些
I've been down the darkest alleys. Saw the dark side of the moon
我曾在陰暗的巷弄裡徘徊，目睹邪惡的念頭蠢蠢欲動
To get to you, to get to you
只為更了解你，貼近你一些
I've looked for love in every stranger. Took too much to ease the anger
我曾周旋在陌生人間尋找歸所，真心卻換來惱火
All for you, yeah, all for you
踏遍人生，只為了遇見你

I've been running through the jungle. I've been crying with the wolves
我曾穿梭過陰鬱叢林，與狼群在月夜下長嚎
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
只為在蒼茫人海間，與你碰頭

To get to you
To get to you

I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves
我曾翻越窮山惡水，與狼群馳騁在荒野間
To get to you, to get to you
只為了靠近你，更靠近你一些
I've been down the darkest alleys. Saw the dark side of the moon
我曾在陰暗的巷弄裡徘徊，目睹邪惡的念頭蠢蠢欲動
To get to you, to get to you
只為更了解你，貼近你一些
I've looked for love in every stranger. Took too much to ease the anger
我曾周旋在陌生人間尋找歸所，真心卻換來惱火
All for you, yeah, all for you
踏遍人生，只為了遇見你
I've been running through the jungle. I've been crying with the wolves
我曾穿梭過陰鬱叢林，與狼群在月夜下長嚎
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
只為在蒼茫人海間，與你碰頭
