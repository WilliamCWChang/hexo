Léon - Think About You


Hey you, are you asleep?

嘿，你睡了嗎？
I wonder if you're out, if you are drinking

我猜想如果你外出的話，一定在某地喝酒吧
It's late, I know

我知道已經很晚了
But baby I ain't wasted, can't you call me?
但我還沒喝醉，你能叫醒我嗎？


Can't get along, can't be alone

無法過活，無法孤隻一人
Where's your mind at?

你怎麼想呢？
Are you on your own?

你也是一個人嗎？
You're falling out, I'm falling back

你脫離了愛情的坑洞，但我卻越陷越深
Where's your heart at?

你的心在哪呢？
Don't you feel alone?
難道你不覺得孤單嗎？


Tell me would you give us one more try

告訴我你是否願意再給彼此一次機會
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind

在我心中一有顆沉重的大石
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你

Your words, they burn

你的言語燃燒殆盡
I read it twice, the way you write is different

你寫信的方式不同以往，但我依然讀了兩次
You're cold, and it's cruel

你真是冷酷無情
Acting like I am someone that you never knew
假裝我是某個你不認識的人


Can't get along, can't be alone

無法過活，無法孤隻一人
Where's your mind at?

你怎麼想呢？
Are you on your own?

你也是一個人嗎？
You're falling out, I'm falling back

你脫離了愛情的坑洞，但我卻越陷越深
Where's your heart at?

你的心在哪呢？
Don't you feel alone?
難道你不覺得孤單嗎？


Tell me would you give us one more try

告訴我你是否願意再給彼此一次機會
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind

在我心中一有顆沉重的大石
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你


I tried but it hurt to lie

我嘗試過，但我被謊言傷過
Don't you remember?

難道你不記得嗎？
Cause I remember

因我我可記得很清楚
I tried but it hurt to lie

我嘗試過，但我被謊言傷過
Don't you remember?

難道你忘了嗎？
Cause I remember

因為我沒忘

Tell me would you give us one more try

告訴我你是否願意再給彼此一次機會
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind

在我心中一有顆沉重的大石
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你

Tell me would you give us one more try

告訴我你是否願意再給彼此一次機會
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind

在我心中一有顆沉重的大石
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

因為我一直在思念你，一直無法忘記你
